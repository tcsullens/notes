## Thoughts

_A_ key to running an engineering team, or perhaps any goal-oriented, deadline-governed team, is achieving a nominal average velocity. I liken it to driving a car: to get going you push the accelerator down a ways, and at some desired speed you start to ease off in order to maintain a nominal speed. If you go to fast for too long, you'll burn the engine out. Too slow for too long, you won't get to were you're going on time. The team leader is the driver: responsible for guiding the car, but also for knowing when and how much pressure to apply to the accelerator to keep things going.


Clear-cut, attainable goals are one of the most important things to morale. There is a positive feedback loop to closing out a ticket/project: the feeling of accomplishment drives people to go back and do it all over again. Focus on developing work that has clear goals and path to facilitate a feeling of _progression_ and _accomplishment_.
