# Notes on Communicating in a Product and Engineering Organization

Notes, tips, guidance, etc, and references gathered from personal experiences.

## General Tips

**BLUF: Bottom Line Up Front.**  
Get to your point quickly and succinctly at the beginning; details later.

**Use simple terms.**  
Summarize your points in simple terms, save the jargon for detailed explanation.


**Say what you like and what you would like, not what you don’t like.**  
A supportive tone is more likely to get a positive response and openness to your suggestion than a critical one.  


## Chat Tips  

**Default to public channels.**  
Private channels and DMs hinder transparency and collaboration.

**Avoid Spamming**  
Each message sends a notification, which can be distracting to the recipient. 
Avoid sending multiple messages if possible; take your time to collect your thoughts, get to your point directly and provide all the necessary context.

**Use threads.**  
Specific conversations should be threaded: this keeps them organized and prevents clutter in the channel.

**Chat is for almost-synchronous, ephemeral communication.**  
Chat should never be used to document a decision, and there should never be a need to “read back” in a channel in fear of missing something. 
Similarly, important information e.g. announcements are not suitable for slack - there are better mediums e.g. email.

**Real-time sometimes, asynchronous most of the time.**  
There should not be an expectation that people should be immediately responsive or present in chat all day long. 

**Fill out your profile.**  
As an organization grows it becomes more difficult to track who’s who. Your organization profile is a primary way for people to know who you are and what you do; fill it out!

**Get familiar with your tool’s formatting.**  
Formatting is extremely important to the readability/digestibility of your communication. Get familiar with your tool’s formatting e.g. slack's formatting tips.

**Contribute thoughtfully.**  
Jumping in to a conversation without contributing something valuable, e.g. vital knowledge, is disruptive.

## Collaborating Effectively

### Asking Good Questions  
In our work, providing an answer to what often may seem a simple query is not always a low-effort exercise, for two reasons:
1. We often need to have context to provide an accurate or correct answer, and this is not always provided up front and takes time to “load-in”; we often have to context-switch in order to give a good answer and this takes time and effort.
2. Providing just the answer is often not good enough. Just as there are low-quality questions, there are low-quality answers; an answer should attempt to also provide the context and information for the asker to be able to figure out the answer to their own question now or next time: providing references, historical context, etc.  

These both take time and consideration! 

- Provide context as to what you’ve done so far, any results of those actions, and what you’re thinking of doing next
- Ask for guidance to help you figure it out yourself, don’t just ask for an answer

>Hey! I’m trying to ..., and so far I’ve tried [solution 1] and [solution 2], and while that’s done X, it hasn’t fully resolved the issue. Could anyone point me to some documentation, a direction, or another possible solution?

>I’m trying to figure out the best way to .... I believe I can do this by [solution 1] or [solution 2], but not sure if either is “better”, or if there’s another way to do this. Does anyone have experience with this that could shed some light here before I proceed with one or the other?

>I’m looking for …, I’ve search through confluence and google docs with no luck, does anyone know where I can find this and/or how I can discover this?

### Tips for Collaborating

**Context and clarity over brevity.**  
Get to the point, but do not assume others have the same context as you, and work to assure clarity. 

**Announce actions before you take them.**  
Talking through steps of an action before you execute has many benefits: your brain digests your actions fully, others are made aware of what’s happening preventing accidental conflict or duplication, others have the chance to reasonably object…

**Summarize.**  
Adding a summarization to a long write-up is helpful for skimming large amounts of information, summarizing actions and results in a long timeline of events is also helpful for people to quickly get context without needing to “read-back”, summarizing a verbal conversation assures clarity of take-aways or next steps, and a written record.

**Closure.**  
Follow up and close out open threads (DMs, message threads) with results.

**Record actions and results in writing.**  
In slack, PR comments, Jira ticket, a google doc, wherever; this provides a log that can be looked at later to rebuild context and an accurate timeline.

**Provide links and summaries.**  
Provide links to external resources and a description or summary of the content along with it. Do not assume others know the context of a certain PR or Jira ticket number: reference it via a summary and link to it in your conversation.

>Existing theoretical perspectives and empirical results suggest that knowledge transfer and collaboration are also affected by the modes of communication that workers use to collaborate with one another. On the theoretical front, media richness theory26,27 posits that richer communication channels, such as in-person interaction, are best suited to communicating complex information and ideas. Moreover, media synchronicity theory28 proposes that asynchronous communication channels (such as email) are better suited for conveying information and synchronous channels (such as video calls) are better suited for converging on the meaning of information.

>...I don’t know if you’re going to have the same “aha” moment where a developer realizes, “Oh my God, I’m going to be 20 times as productive if I write better documentation.” The organization will be 20 times as productive.  
>I think a thing you learn, obviously in any kind of creative work, maybe in writing it’s especially vivid, is that all writing is rewriting, is what my sophomore English teacher said to me.
